My name is Francisco Neves, and I am a portuguese student in the Netherlands. I study [Economics and Business Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/bachelor/international-bachelor-economics-and-business-economics) at [Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en). My main interests are Economics, Philosophy and Politics. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:598499fd@eur.nl) if there is something I can help you with!
