Hi! My name is Francisco Neves, and I am originally from Portugal. I currently live in the United Kingdom, where I study Economics. Besides Economics, I am interested in a range of different topics and fields. I have a newsletter, [Portuguese Efficiency](https://fdscn.substack.com), where I occasionally write about some of these things. Feel free to reach out in case I can be of any help!
