  My name is Francisco Neves, and I am originally from Portugal. I graduated *cum laude* with a BSc in [Economics and Business Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/bachelor/international-bachelor-economics-and-business-economics) from [Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en). I have a newsletter, [Portuguese Efficiency](https://fdscn.substack.com), where I occasionally write about whatever I find interesting.
