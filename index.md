  My name is Francisco Neves, and I am a Portuguese. I graduated *cum laude* with a BSc in [Economics and Business Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/bachelor/international-bachelor-economics-and-business-economics) at [Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en). My main interests are Economics, Philosophy and Politics. I also have a newsletter, [Portuguese Efficiency](https://fdscn.substack.com). Feel free to connect with me if there is anything I can help you with!
