## Bachelor's Degree - Economics and Business Economics 


Here you can find the study materials I used for my first year of IBEB. I mostly used flashcards (for active recall and spaced repetition), although I did use notes for Macroeconomics, for example. In order to open the flashcards, you have to download [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and import the deck. The flashcards are in .apkg format, and the notes are pdfs. if you would like some study tips or if you have any questions! If you share these resources, please be so kind as to credit the source :)

## How I study 

When I study, I try to incorporate insights from techniques such as Active Recall and Spaced Repetition, which are not only scientifically proven, but have also worked well for me. Here are some of the videos that I drew inspiration from:
