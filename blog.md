Here you can find the study materials I used for my first year of IBEB. I mostly used flashcards (active recall and spaced repetition), although I did use notes for Macro, for example. In order to open the flashcards, you have to download anki and import the deck. The flashcards are in .apkg format, and the notes are pdfs.

How I study

When I study, I try to incorporate insights from techniques such as Active Recall and Spaced Repetition, which are not only scientifically proven, but have worked perfectly for me. Here are some of the videos that I drew inspiration from:
