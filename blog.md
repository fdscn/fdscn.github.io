Here you can find the study materials I used for my first year of IBEB. I mostly used flashcards (active recall and spaced repetition), although I did use notes for Macro, for example. In order to open the flashcards, you have to download anki and import the deck. The flashcards are in .apkg format, and the notes are pdfs.
